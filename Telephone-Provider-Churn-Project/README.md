Overview: 
The goal of this project is to create tree based models(Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost) that predicts whether a person will churn, that is will discontinue service from the telecom provider based on features like gender, 
tenure, contract type, monthly charges, total charges etc.

Datasets used:
The dataset used in this project contains 7032 rows with features like gender, tenure, contract type, monthly charges, total charges etc.


Conclusion:
The performance of various tree based model on the given dataset has been evaluated.

How to download and run the project:

1.Download the entire project. 
2.Run each file to view visualizations. 
3.Before running the file make sure that the correct filepath is provided while importing the dataset in code. 
In each file, the statement for importing the dataset is present.
This statement is of the form - pd.read_csv(r'filepath/datasetname.csv')
Here filepath should be the actual filepath where you have downloaded and stored the dataset.
