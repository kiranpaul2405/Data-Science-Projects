Overview:
Several online sites provide reviews and ratings for movies that are released. Some of them sell tickets along with providing these ratings. The goal of this project is to check if one such site(www.fandango.com) is artificially boosting up ratings of movies so that their tickets get sold more often through data visualizations.

Datasets used:

There are 2 main datasets used in this project. The first dataset has the ratings and score provided by fandango for movies released in mostly 2015. The second dataset contains ratings and scores provided by other sites(Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and IMDB). The main idea is to compare between the ratings provided by Fandango and other sites so as to conclude whether Fandango is actually rating movies higher so that their tickets gets sold easily.

Conclusion:

It has been viewed and verified through visualizations that Fandango is indeed rating movies higher so that their ticket sales are not affected by the movie ratings. Fandango seems not to be harsh on movies that are rated low on other sites.
